# Cadl Playground

A web app to play with Cadl in the browser.

Todo when dropping node 14: Ability to call the typescript test directly without precompiling.

```json5
"e2e": "cross-env PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM=1 playwright test -c e2e ",
"e2e:headed": "cross-env PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM=1 playwright test -c e2e --headed",
```
